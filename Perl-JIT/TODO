* Find a better way to handle many types of OPs: clearly
  a giant switch isn't pretty.
* Along the same lines, "foo${a}bar$b" currently generates a giant
  concat OP tree. If not for overloading and friends, this could be
  converted to a join-like operation.
...
* Fix B::Replace
  - handle multiple predecessors (logical ops, ternary)
  - error handling (fail cleanly)
  - test!
* Context
* LVALUE context for assignments
* JIT assignments, =, +=
  - list assignments ($x, $y) = ($y, $x)
* Port to LLVM instead of libjit?
* Support everything the old JIT does
* Fix Emit code
* Check support for logical/ternary ops
* Subtrees
  - order of evaluation 
  - check nested runloop
* Refactor AST construction logic
  * richer type system
* Support more type than just doubles (at least at the AST level)
* Fix all TODOs in Emit.pm
* Think about integrating guards at runtime
* Extract information from subs
  - number of argument
  - inline call for "simple" subs
    - but think about caller
* Globals (for $_)
* Use a custom peephole to handle type annotations
