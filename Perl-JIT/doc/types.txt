Scalars

- variables without explicit type declaration are of unspecified type
- variables with Scalar type have full scalar semantics
  (tie, overload, int -> float upgrade, ...)
- variables with String/Double/Int/UnsignedInt type have restricted
  semantics (not necessarily C, but likely more similar to C than to Perl)

- a variable with an explicit declaration is always treated with
  the declared semantics
- a variable without an explicit declaration "inherits" the most
  relaxed semantics (i.e. if it is only assigned Doubles will have double
  semantics, if it is assigned Doubles and Scalars will have Scalar semantics
  from the point of Scalar assignment onwards)

- an operation that uses a value with Scalar semantics returns a value
  with Scalar semantics
  - note that in Perl, tie/overload can propagate magic to their
    parameters (which are passed by reference) but we're explicitly
    ignoring this
- an operation that only uses values with restricted semantics returns
  a value with restricted semantics (typically)

- a variable with restricted semantics can be stored either as a pad scalar
  or as a JIT variable
  - when stored as a scalar, magic is *never* invoked (and it's an error
    if the user tries to tie() the variable? if the variable is passed
    to a subroutine and comes back with magic?)
  - the variable is stored as a scalar when it is used in trees that
    are not JITted, otherwise it can be stored as a JIT variable
  - when the variable is stored as a scalar but is used in multiple
    consecutive JITted operation, the scalar get/set can be performed only
    when entering/exiting the JIT code, and intermediate assignment
    might only involve a temporary JIT value

- when a variable with Scalar semantics is assigned to a variable with
  restricted semantics, get magic is invoked on the Scalar, and the
  result is coerced to the target value
- the other way around, the assignment works "as if" the restricted value
  were converted to a Perl scalar and assigned (but, for example, if the
  Scalar does not have "set" magic, a plain SV*V_set() works as well)

TBD for references, arrays, hashes, ...
