- for most numeric operations (either operators or named unaries like sin())
  having a Scalar variable anywhere in the subtree makes the whole
  subtree not JITtable
- other operations (for example scalar/list ranges, chr, ord, ...)
  do not propagate Scalar-ness to their result
- a variable in a statement can be
  - explicitly written to (assignment, cho(m)p, pre/post inc, ...)
  - maybe written to (passed as a sub parameter)
  - read from

The JIT receives as input a list of expression trees, in execution
sequence (check that it's true) or, at some point, a single AST for the
whole subroutine

It needs to:

- examine each expression in turn, determining which subtrees can be JITted
  and which can't
- for each JITtable subtree, it needs to keep track of which variables are
  assigned to in the JITted subtree and read elsewhere in the subroutine,
  these need to be written back on exit of the JITted subtree
  - note that _elsewhere_ includes in a non-JITted subree or in any
    JITted subtree contained in a non-JITted subtree
  - just counting the number of uses of the variable (total and inside the
    subtree) and checking whether they are equal should work; the total
    number of uses can be gathered while building the AST
    => What about globals, "no strict" and symbolic refs?
    => eval kills it all, of course.

- do the same for variables read in the JITted tree after having been
  assigned in a non JITted *subtree* of the JITted tree
  - reasonably easy to implement, just needs the extra information about
    which variables are written by an AST node

- first approximation
  - each variable used in the JITted code is going to have a JIT
    value (in the jit_value_t sense) holding it; the value can be
    fresh, dirty and stale (find better names...)
    - fresh means the JIT value matches the pad value, the two can
      be used interchangeably
    - dirty means the variable has been written in JIT code and needs to
      be written back to the pad
    - stale means the variable has been written in Perl code and needs
      to be read back from the pad
      => Which may be hard/impossible to detect in the presence of subtrees.
         So therefore, executing a wholly opaque subtree will necessarily
         have to mark all variables as stale, see below. Fundamentally, that
         also means anything that is dirty will have to be written back
         before we risk it being read from.
  - while emitting a JITted subtree, generate a single JIT value to hold
    the temporary value of a variable (both read and written)
  - when written, mark the value as "dirty"
  - before emitting a non-JITted subtree, find all variables read in the
    subtree, write them back to pad if dirty, and then mark them as
    fresh
  - after emitting a JITted subtree, find all variables written in the subtree
    and mark them as "stale"

- decide what to do for maybe written to variables (sub parameters)
  (I'd say treat them as read, ignore the maybe-written-to)
    => Wow, bold. --Steffen :)
- for now (until we have an AST for the whole subroutine)
  - for nodes of type Optree, assume every variable used in the tree is
    both read from and written to
  - when exiting an AST, write all values to the corresponding PAD variable,
    (except for variables that are never mentioned outside non-JITted code)
- we're not computing define-use chains, nor taking into account
  the flow-control structure, hence we are doing some extra work
  (for example in the case the variable is *first* used in a non-JITted
   tree, then used in a JITted tree, and never used after that, we're still
   generating code to write back the value to the pad)
